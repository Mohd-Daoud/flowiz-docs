The **Dashboard** is your command center. It tells you if your campaigns are working or if they need adjustment.

## Campaign Status

At the top of the dashboard, you will see four key counters:

* **Completed Automation:** Campaigns that have finished sending all messages.
* **Running Automation:** Campaigns currently active and sending.
* **Draft Automation:** Flows you have created but haven't launched yet.

## Agent Performance

This graph shows you the effectiveness of your different channels.

### How to Read This
* **Sent:** Total messages delivered.
* **Opened:** (Email Only) How many people opened your email.
* **Replied:** The most important metric. This shows how many leads are interested.

<Tip>
  **Optimization:** If your "Opened" rate is high but "Replied" is low, try changing your message content (Template) to be more engaging.
