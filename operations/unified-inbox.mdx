When a lead replies to your automated campaign, the AI stops sending messages and hands the conversation over to you.

## The Conversations Tab

All replies land in the **Unified Inbox**. You don't need to check your Gmail or phone separately.

## How it Works

1.  **The Left Sidebar:** Shows a list of all active conversations.
    * **Icon:** Indicates the channel (Envelope = Email, Green Bubble = WhatsApp).
    * **Name:** The lead's name.
    * **Snippet:** The last message received.
2.  **The Chat Window:** This looks just like a standard chat app. You can type your reply at the bottom and hit **Send**.

<Note>
  **Human Takeover:** Once you reply manually here, the automated "Flow" for that specific user is paused to prevent the bot from interrupting your human conversation.
