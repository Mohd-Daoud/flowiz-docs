To use Flowiz effectively, you need to understand three main terms. Think of Flowiz like a digital agency:

1.  **Agents** are your workers.
2.  **Recipes** are the instruction manuals.
3.  **Flows** are the active jobs.

## 1. AI Agents

Agents are specialized bots designed to handle specific communication channels. You don't write scripts for them; you just turn them on and give them a personality.

{/* Save screenshot as 'agents-list.png' in images folder */}

  alt="List of Flowiz Agents"
/>

| Agent Type | Function | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email Agent** | Sends cold emails, follow-ups, and manages replies. | B2B Sales, Newsletters |
| **WhatsApp Agent** | Sends instant messages and handles 24/7 chat. | High-response offers |
| **WebBot** | sits on your website to answer visitor questions. | Inbound Support |

## 2. Recipes

A **Recipe** is a pre-built template for a campaign. Instead of building a workflow from scratch, you select a Recipe that matches your goal.

{/* ## IMAGE - ADD RECIPES POPUP SCREENSHOT HERE ## */}
{/* Save screenshot as 'recipes-popup.png' in images folder */}
<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/recipes-popup.png"
  alt="Flowiz Recipes Popup"
/>

Common Recipes include:
* **Cold Email Outreach:** Extract leads from Excel -> Send Email -> Wait 2 days -> Follow up.
* **WhatsApp Blaster:** Extract from Google Maps -> Verify Phone -> Send WhatsApp Message.

## 3. Flows

A **Flow** is a live automation. Once you select a Recipe and click "Automate", it becomes a Flow.

You can visualize a Flow as a series of connected steps on a canvas.

<Note>
  **Pro Tip:** You can pause, edit, or delete Flows at any time from the "Automations" tab in your dashboard.
