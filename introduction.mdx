## What is Flowiz?

Flowiz is a complete automation ecosystem that replaces manual sales work with intelligent **AI Agents**. Unlike traditional tools where you have to connect disparate apps (like scrapers, email verification, and CRMs), Flowiz unifies the entire workflow into a single visual interface.

{/* 1. Take a screenshot of the main Dashboard (with the charts). */}
{/* 2. Save it as 'dashboard.png' in your 'images' folder. */}
{/* LIGHT MODE IMAGE */}
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/dashboard-light.png"
  alt="Flowiz Dashboard Light"
/>
{/* DARK MODE IMAGE */}
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/dashboard-dark.png"
  alt="Flowiz Dashboard Dark"
/>

## How It Works

Flowiz operates on a simple "Prompt-to-Flow" logic. You don't need to be a developer to build complex automations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Goal">
    Use the **AI Flow Prompt** to describe what you want (e.g., *"Find marketing agencies in New York and send them an intro email"*).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Recipe">
    Choose from pre-built **Recipes** that structure your campaign automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Agents">
    Switch on your **Email**, **WhatsApp**, or **WebBot** agents to handle the execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>
