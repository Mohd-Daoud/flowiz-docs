## What is Flowiz?

Flowiz is a full automation ecosystem that uses intelligent **AI Agents** to replace manual sales work. Flowiz unifies the entire workflow into a single visual interface, in contrast to traditional tools that require you to connect disparate apps (such as scrapers, email verification, and CRMs).
