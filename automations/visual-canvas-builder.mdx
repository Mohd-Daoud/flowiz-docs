Once a Flow is generated, it opens in the **Visual Canvas**. This is your workspace for fine-tuning the campaign.

## The Interface

The canvas represents your campaign timeline from left to right.
* **Nodes:** The boxes representing actions (e.g., "Send Email").
* **Edges:** The lines connecting the nodes, representing the path of the lead.

## Understanding Nodes

There are four main types of nodes you will see on the canvas:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trigger Node" icon="play">
    The starting point. Usually "New Lead Added" or "Audience Upload".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Action Node" icon="bolt">
    Performs a task. Examples: **Send Email**, **WhatsApp Message**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logic Node" icon="code-branch">
    Diamond-shaped boxes that make decisions (e.g., "Did they reply?").
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delay Node" icon="clock">
    Pauses the flow. Example: "Wait 24 Hours".
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Editing a Flow

To change settings, simply **click on any node**. A configuration panel will slide out from the right side of the screen.

### Common Actions
* **Edit Content:** Click an Email node to change the Subject Line or Body text.
* **Delete Step:** Click the trash icon on a node to remove it.
* **Reconnect:** Click and drag from the circle on one node to the circle on another to create a new path.
