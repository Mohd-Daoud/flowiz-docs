The fastest way to start a campaign in Flowiz is using a **Recipe**.

A Recipe is a pre-configured workflow that connects data sources (like Google Maps) to Action Agents (like Email or WhatsApp).

## Accessing the Library

To open the Recipe Library:
1. Go to the **Automations** tab.
2. Click the purple **+ Add Automation** button in the top right corner.

## Choosing a Strategy

The library is divided into strategies based on your goal.
