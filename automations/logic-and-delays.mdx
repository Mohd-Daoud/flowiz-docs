title: Logic & Delays

A linear campaign (Step 1 -> Step 2) is simple, but real sales require **Logic**. You need to treat people differently based on how they behave.

## The Delay Node

The Delay Node (Clock Icon) pauses the automation for a specific amount of time. This is crucial for "drip campaigns" where you don't want to spam the user.

{/* ## IMAGE - DELAY SETTINGS ## */}
{/* Save as 'delay-settings.png' */}
<img
  className="h-64 block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/delay-settings-light.png"
  alt="Delay Settings Light"
/>
<img
  className="h-64 hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/delay-settings-dark.png"
  alt="Delay Settings Dark"
/>

**Common Uses:**
* **Wait 2 Days:** Before sending a follow-up email.
* **Wait 15 Minutes:** Between extracting a lead and sending a WhatsApp message (to look natural).

## The Logic Node (Decision)

The Logic Node (Diamond Icon) splits your flow into two paths: **YES** and **NO**.

{/* ## IMAGE - LOGIC NODE ## */}
{/* Save as 'logic-node.png' */}
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/logic-node-light.png"
  alt="Logic Node Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/logic-node-dark.png"
  alt="Logic Node Dark"
/>

### How it Works
The AI automatically assigns the condition.
* **Path A (Positive):** "If User Responds Positively" -> Send Booking Link.
* **Path B (Negative):** "If User Responds Negatively" -> Remove from list.
* **Path C (No Reply):** "If No Reply after 3 days" -> Send Follow-up.
