At the heart of Flowiz is the **Generative AI Engine**. Instead of dragging and dropping every single step manually, you can simply describe what you want to achieve in plain English.

## How It Works

When you type a prompt, the AI analyzes your intent and translates it into a structured "Flow."

1.  **Input:** "Send a WhatsApp message to leads who didn't reply to my email after 3 days."
2.  **AI Processing:** The system identifies:
    * **Trigger:** Email status = "No Reply"
    * **Condition:** Time = "3 Days"
    * **Action:** WhatsApp Agent

## Writing Effective Prompts

To get the best results, structure your prompt with these three elements: **Target**, **Channel**, and **Goal**.

| Element | Question to Answer | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target** | Who are we contacting? | "Marketing agencies in Mumbai..." |
| **Channel** | How are we reaching them? | "...using Email for the first contact..." |
| **Goal** | What is the outcome? | "...to get them to book a demo." |

### Prompt Examples

**✅ Good Prompt:**
> "Find software companies in Bangalore, extract their CTO's email, send a professional introduction, and if they don't reply in 48 hours, send a follow-up."

**❌ Bad Prompt:**
> "Find customers and email them."

## Auto-Detected Information

As you type, Flowiz automatically fills in the **Business Details** below the prompt box. Always double-check these fields before clicking "Automate" to ensure the AI knows exactly who you are.
