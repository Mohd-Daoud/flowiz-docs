Flowiz provides a roster of specialized AI Agents, each designed for a specific channel and purpose.

## The Agent Roster

| Agent Type | Best Use Case | Key Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email Agent** | B2B Outreach | Generates personalized subject lines, handles follow-up sequencing, and manages SMTP rotation. |
| **WhatsApp Agent** | B2C Engagement | Sends instant messages, handles automated replies, and manages template messages. |
| **WebBot Agent** | Inbound Support | Sits on your website to answer visitor questions and capture leads 24/7. |
| **Call Agent** | Qualification | Uses synthetic voice (Text-to-Speech) to conduct surveys or qualify leads via phone. |

## Combining Agents (Recipes)

The true power of Flowiz comes from chaining agents together into a **Recipe**.

**Example Recipe:**
1.  **Email Agent** sends an intro.
2.  *Wait 2 Days.*
3.  If no reply, **WhatsApp Agent** sends a "Did you see this?" nudge.
4.  If the lead replies, **WebBot Agent** takes over to schedule a demo.
