## How Extraction Works

Flowiz uses **Intelligent Scraper Agents** to navigate these platforms in real-time.

1.  **Select Source:** Choose the platform (e.g., Google Maps).
2.  **Input Criteria:** Type your search term exactly as you would on the site itself.
3.  **Run:** The agent visits the site, scrolls through results, and parses the data into a clean table.

<Warning>
  **Compliance Note:** When scraping public data, ensure you verify email addresses before sending to protect your domain reputation.
