The **WebBot** is a defensive agent. While other agents go *out* to find leads, the WebBot waits on your site to answer questions from visitors 24/7.

## Installation

To add the widget to your site, you need to copy the installation script.

1.  Click the **Settings (Gear)** icon next to **WebBot**.
2.  Copy the code snippet provided in the "Installation" tab.

{/* ## IMAGE - WEBBOT SCRIPT ## */}
{/* Save as 'webbot-script.png' */}
<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/webbot-script.png"
  alt="WebBot Installation Script"
/>

### Where to Paste
Paste the code into the `<head>` section of your website's HTML.

* **WordPress:** Use a plugin like "Insert Headers and Footers".
* **Custom Site:** Paste it before the closing `</head>` tag in `index.html`.

## Training the Bot

You can upload documents to train the bot on your business.
* **Upload PDF:** Upload your pricing guide or brochure.
* **Website URL:** Enter your website link, and the bot will read your pages to learn about you.
