### Key Settings

1.  **Agent Personality:**
    Describe how the bot should sound.
    * *Example:* "You are a helpful sales assistant named Sarah. Be professional but brief."
2.  **Daily Limit:**
    We recommend starting with **50 emails/day** for a new account to avoid spam filters.
3.  **Signature:**
    Paste your standard HTML or text signature here.

## Connecting Your Account

Flowiz supports SMTP connections. You will need:
* **SMTP Host:** (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
* **Port:** (Usually `587` or `465`)
* **App Password:** If using Gmail, you must generate an "App Password," not your normal login password.

<Warning>
  **Spam Compliance:** Always include an "Unsubscribe" text in your footer to comply with regulations.
