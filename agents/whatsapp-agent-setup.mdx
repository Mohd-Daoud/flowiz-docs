The **WhatsApp Agent** allows you to send automated messages directly to your lead's phone. Unlike email, WhatsApp has open rates as high as 98%.

## Connection Method

Flowiz uses a "Web Session" connection. You do not need the expensive official WhatsApp API; you can use your existing phone number.

### How to Connect
1.  Toggle the **WhatsApp Agent** switch to **ON**.
2.  Wait for the **QR Code** to generate.
3.  Open WhatsApp on your phone -> Settings -> **Linked Devices**.
4.  Scan the code on the screen.

## Session Management

Once connected, your "Status" will change to **Active**.

<Note>
  **Keep your phone charged:** Since this uses a web session, your phone must have an active internet connection for messages to send.

## Safety Limits

To avoid being banned by WhatsApp:
* **Warm-up:** Start with 10-20 messages/day.
* **Delays:** Use the "Delay Node" to wait at least 2 minutes between messages.
* **Replies:** If a user replies "Stop", the Agent will automatically blacklist them.
