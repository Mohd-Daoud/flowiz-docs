Flowiz allows you to turn Google Maps into a database. You don't need to buy lead lists; you can generate them in real-time.

## How to Extract

Extraction is handled via a **Recipe**.

1.  Go to **Automations** -> **+ Add Automation**.
2.  Select the **"Initiate WhatsApp/Email conversations with leads collected from Google Maps"** recipe.

{/* Save as 'gmaps-recipe-card.png' */}

  alt="Google Maps Recipe"
/>

## Configuring the Search

In the Flow Prompt, you simply specify the **Business Type** and **Location**.

> **Example Prompt:** "Find *Gyms* in *South Delhi* and extract their phone numbers."

The system will:
1.  Scan Google Maps for the keyword "Gym".
2.  Filter for the location "South Delhi".
3.  Visit each profile to find a public email address or phone number.
4.  Add valid results to your "Leads" tab automatically.
