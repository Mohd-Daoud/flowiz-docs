If you already have a list of clients (e.g., from an old CRM or a trade show), you can upload them directly.

## The Upload Process

1.  Navigate to the **Leads** tab.
2.  Click the purple **+ Add Multiple Leads** button on the right side.

{/* ## IMAGE - UPLOAD POPUP ## */}
{/* Save as 'upload-popup.png' */}
<img
  className="h-64"
  src="/images/upload-popup.png"
  alt="Add Multiple Leads Popup"
/>

## File Formatting

For the best results, ensure your Excel or CSV file has clear headers in the first row.

| Recommended Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Name` | The full name of the prospect. |
| `Email` | Essential for Email Agents. |
| `Phone` | Essential for WhatsApp/Call Agents (include Country Code!). |
| `Company` | Useful for AI personalization. |

<Note>
  **Phone Number Format:** Flowiz works best when phone numbers include the country code (e.g., `+919876543210` instead of just `9876543210`).
