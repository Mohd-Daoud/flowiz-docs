In Flowiz, leads are grouped into **Audiences**. Think of an Audience like a Folder.

## Understanding Audiences

When you extract leads or upload a file, Flowiz creates a new Audience card.

{/* ## IMAGE - AUDIENCE CARDS ## */}
{/* Save as 'audience-cards.png' */}
<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/audience-cards.png"
  alt="Audience Cards in Leads Tab"
/>

* **Unlocked Audience:** These are leads that have been verified and are ready for outreach.
* **New Audience:** These are raw uploads that haven't been processed yet.

## Cleaning Data

To remove bad data:
1. Click on an Audience card to open the list.
2. Select the specific lead.
3. Click **Delete** to remove them from future campaigns.

<Tip>
  **Segmenting:** It is better to keep different business types in different Audiences (e.g., "Restaurant List" vs "Gym List") so you can write specific prompts for each.
