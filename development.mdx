## What is Flowiz?

**Flowiz** is a Zero-Code AI Automation platform designed to democratize sales engineering. It allows businesses to automate the entire lifecycle of a lead—from "unknown" to "engaged prospect"—without writing a single line of code.

By consolidating lead extraction, verification, and multi-channel outreach into a single "Flow," Flowiz replaces the need for multiple disjointed tools.

* **Templates & Recipes:** Use pre-built message structures ("Templates") or complete campaign playbooks ("Recipes").
